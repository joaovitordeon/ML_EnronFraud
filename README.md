# Machine Learning in case of Enron fraud


Enron was the seventh largest company in the United States and one of the largest energy companies in the world. But In 2001, when the communications industry began<br>
a series of losses on the American stock exchange, Enron's movements began to be analyzed more carefully by the authorities.  Inside and outside the company rumors began<br> 
to emerge about the great fraud being conducted by the company.  After the trial of directors, shareholders and officials linked to the frauds, hundreds of thousands of<br>
emails were leaked on the internet, including a lot of information about these people.
<br>
In this project we will analyze -through machine learning- this leaked information and try to predict possible persons of interest(POI's).
<br>
The whole process of cleaning, creating variables, visualizing and creating classifiers is in the file `poi_id.py` and the complete report of these processes is in the<br> 
file `MachineLearningReport.pdf`.
